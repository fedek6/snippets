# Random numbers

Random integer between min (included) and max (included):

```js
const min = 1;
const max = 3;

Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
```

Any random number (even float) between min (included) and max (not included):

```js
const min = 1;
const max = 3;

Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
```
