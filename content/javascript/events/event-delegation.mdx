# Event delegation

A basic example of modern JS event delegation:

```js
const selector = ".class-name";

document.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
  const clikedElement = e.target;

  if (clikedElement.matches(selector)) {
    console.log("Targeted element was clicked", clikedElement);
  } else {
    console.log("Other element was clicked", clikedElement);
  }
});
```
