# Capture longer mouse press

There's a problem when you want to capture a longer mouse press using `mousedown` and `mouseup`. When user moves a cursor outside of the target, event does not fire as intended.

Here's a simple solution. You need to capture `mouseup` event also outside of the original target.

Demo available [here](https://jsfiddle.net/fedek6/w5hngvqe/7/).

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");

document.addEventListener("mousedown", (e) => {
  const { target } = e;

  if (target.matches("button")) {
    console.log("button pressed");
    button.classList.add("-active");
  }
});

document.addEventListener("mouseup", (e) => {
  const { target } = e;

  button.classList.remove("-active");

  if (target.matches("button")) {
    console.log("button depressed");
  } else {
    console.log("depressed outside");
  }
});
```
