# The basics of assertions

<LiveExample link="https://jsfiddle.net/fedek6/yc2tb9um/" />

Using type assertions is like being smarter that TS compiler. In fact, you're telling compiler that returned value is a specific type.

```ts
let taxNumber = calculateTax(100, false) as number;
let taxString = calculateTax(100, true) as string;
console.log(`Number Value: ${taxNumber.toFixed(2)}`);
console.log(`String Value: ${taxString.charAt(0)}`);
```

**Attention!** No conversion is used when asserting a type. This is information is used only by the compiler.

Asserted types can be selected from returned union:

```ts
function calculateTax(amount: number, format: boolean): string | number {
  const calcAmount = amount * 1.2;
  return format ? `${calcAmount.toFixed(2)}` : calcAmount;
}

// Assert as a string
const taxString = calculateTax(100.455, true) as string;
console.log(taxString.constructor.name, taxString);

// Assert as a number
const taxFloat = calculateTax(100.455, false) as number;
console.log(taxFloat.constructor.name, taxFloat);

// Alternative assertion syntax
const tax = <number>calculateTax(1214.1, false);
console.log(tax.constructor.name, tax);
```

## Forced assertions

If you want to assert forcibly you can use this trick:

```ts
let taxBoolean = calculateTax(100, false) as any as boolean;
```
