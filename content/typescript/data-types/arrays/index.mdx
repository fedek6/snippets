# Arrays

TypeScript doesn't change the flexible sizing of arrays, but it does allow the data types they contain to be restricted through the use of type annotations.

```ts
let prices: number[] = [100, 75, 42];
let names: string[] = ["Hat", "Gloves", "Umbrella"];

prices.forEach((price: number, index: number) => {
  console.log(names[index], calculateTax(price));
});
```

This can be typed using alternative syntax:

```ts
let prices: Array<number> = [100, 75, 42];
let names: Array<string> = ["Hat", "Gloves", "Umbrella"];
```

**Warning!** This will bring error in tsx files.

## Array good practices

### ✔️ Avoid using inferred array types

As you can see, this might lead to mistakes:

```ts
// declare let prices: (string | number)[]
let prices = [100, 75, 42, "20"];

const calculateTax = (prices: Array<number>): Array<number> => {
  return prices.map((price) => price * 0.23);
};

// ❌ Argument of type '(string | number)[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number[]'
calculateTax(prices);
```

### ✔️ Always type empty arrays

This will be typed as `any` which is a very bad practice:

```ts
let prices = [];
```
